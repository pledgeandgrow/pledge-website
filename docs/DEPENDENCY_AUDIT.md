# Dependency Audit Report

## Summary
- **Audit Date**: June 1, 2025
- **Result**: No vulnerabilities detected
- **Total Dependencies**: 639
  - Production: 305
  - Development: 298
  - Optional: 59
  - Peer: 1

## Audit Details
The npm audit command was run against the project dependencies and found no security vulnerabilities. This is a good sign that the project is using secure dependencies.

## Recommendations for Ongoing Security

### Regular Audits
- Run `npm audit` weekly to check for new vulnerabilities
- Set up automated dependency scanning in your CI/CD pipeline

### Dependency Management
- Keep dependencies updated with `npm update` regularly
- Consider using `npm outdated` to identify packages that need updates
- Use `npm audit fix` when vulnerabilities are found

### Version Pinning
- Pin dependency versions in package.json to prevent unexpected updates
- Consider using package-lock.json to ensure consistent installations

### Production Deployment
- Use `npm ci` instead of `npm install` in production builds for consistent installations
- Consider using `npm prune --production` before deployment to remove dev dependencies

### Monitoring
- Set up GitHub Dependabot alerts for automatic vulnerability notifications
- Consider using Snyk or similar tools for deeper dependency scanning

## Next Steps
1. Implement automated dependency scanning in CI/CD pipeline
2. Create a schedule for regular dependency updates
3. Document procedures for addressing vulnerabilities when found

## Notes
While no vulnerabilities were found at this time, dependency security is an ongoing process. Regular audits and updates are essential to maintain security over time.
