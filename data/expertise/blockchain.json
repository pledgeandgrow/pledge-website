      "question": "Is blockchain right for my business?",
      "answer": "Blockchain is particularly valuable for scenarios requiring transparency, trust between parties, immutable record-keeping, or disintermediation. We'll help you evaluate whether blockchain adds genuine value to your specific use case."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which blockchain platform should we use?",
      "answer": "The right platform depends on your specific requirements. Public blockchains like Ethereum are ideal for applications needing maximum decentralization, while private solutions like Hyperledger offer better performance and privacy for enterprise use cases."
