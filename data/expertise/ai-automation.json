    {
      "question": "Do we need a large amount of data to implement AI?",
      "answer": "While more data generally leads to better AI models, we can work with various data volumes. For smaller datasets, we can use transfer learning, synthetic data generation, or pre-trained models to achieve good results."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to develop an AI solution?",
      "answer": "Timelines vary based on complexity. A basic implementation might take 2-3 months, while more sophisticated solutions can take 6+ months to develop, train, and deploy."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you ensure AI ethics and transparency?",
      "answer": "We follow ethical AI principles throughout development, including bias detection, explainability methods, and privacy-preserving techniques. Our solutions are designed to be transparent and accountable."
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of ROI can we expect from AI implementation?",
      "answer": "ROI varies by application, but our clients typically see returns through cost savings (20-40% in automated processes), revenue growth (10-30% with personalization), or risk reduction. We'll help define clear success metrics for your specific project."
